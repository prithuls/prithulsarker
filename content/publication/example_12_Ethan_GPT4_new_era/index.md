abstract: GPT-4 is the latest version of ChatGPT which is reported by OpenAI to have greater problem-solving abilities and an even broader knowledge base. We examined GPT-4â€™s ability to inform us about the latest literature in a given area, and to write a discharge summary for a patient following an uncomplicated surgery and its latest image analysis feature which was reported to be able to identify objects in photos. All things considered, GPT-4 has the potential to help drive medical innovation, from aiding with patient discharge notes, summarizing recent clinical trials, providing information on ethical guidelines, and much more.
