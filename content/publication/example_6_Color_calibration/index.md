abstract: "Immersion in virtual environments is an important analog for scientists. Situations that cannot be safely organized in the real world are being simulated virtually to observe, evaluate, and train aspects of human behavior for psychology, therapy, and assessment. However, creating an immersive environment using traditional graphics practices may create conflict with a researcherâ€™s goal of evaluating user response to well-defined visual stimuli. Standard computer monitors may display color-accurate stimuli, but it is generally viewed from a seating position, where the participant can see real-world visual context. In this article, we propose a novel means to allow vision scientists to exert finer control over the participants visual stimuli and context. We propose and verify a device-agnostic approach to color calibration by analyzing display properties such as luminance, spectral distribution, and chromaticity. We evaluated five different head-mounted displays from different manufacturers and showed how our approach produces conforming visual outputs."
