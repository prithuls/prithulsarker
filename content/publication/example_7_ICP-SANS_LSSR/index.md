abstract: "The National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) has rigorously documented a group of neuro-ophthalmic findings in astronauts during and after long-duration spaceflight known as spaceflight associated neuro-ocular syndrome (SANS). For astronaut safety and mission effectiveness, understanding SANS and countermeasure development are of utmost importance. Although the pathogenesis of SANS is not well defined, a leading hypothesis is that SANS might relate to a sub-clinical increased intracranial pressure (ICP) from cephalad fluid shifts in microgravity. However, no direct ICP measurements are available during spaceflight. To further understand the role of ICP in SANS, pupillometry can serve as a promising non-invasive biomarker for spaceflight environment as ICP is correlated with the pupil variables under illumination. Extended reality (XR) can help to address certain limitations in current methods for efficient pupil testing during spaceflight. We designed a protocol to quantify parameters of pupil reactivity in XR with an equivalent time duration of illumination on each eye compared to pre-existing, non-XR methods. Throughout the assessment, the pupil diameter data was collected using HTC Vive Pro-VR headset, thanks to its eye-tracking capabilities. Finally, the data was used to compute several pupil variables. We applied our methods to 36 control subjects. Pupil variables such as maximum and minimum pupil size, constriction amplitude, average constriction amplitude, maximum constriction velocity, latency and dilation velocity were computed for each control data. We compared our methods of calculation of pupil variables with the non-XR methods existing in the literature. Distributions of the pupil variables such as latency, constriction amplitude, and velocity of 36 control data displayed near-identical results from the non-XR literature for normal subjects. We propose a new method to evaluate pupil reactivity with XR technology to further understand ICP's role in SANS and provide further insight into SANS countermeasure development for future spaceflight."
