Hi there, I am Prithul Sarker. Thanks for visiting my portfolio website. I earned my PhD from the University of Nevada, Reno, in December 2024. Currently, I am working as a software engineer at Google. My doctoral research focused on unsupervised anomaly detection using score-based generative modeling for multivariate time series data. In this research, I also investigated the use of my proposed method for classifying assessment-based time series data on concussion and ocular disease case studies. My research primarily focuses on AI in healthcare, particularly score-based generative modeling for anomaly detection and classification task. Previously, I analyzed pupillary function using virtual reality-based eye tracking data to detect conditions like traumatic brain injury (TBI a.k.a. concussion), Relative Afferent Pupillary Defect (RAPD), and Spaceflight-Associated Neuro-Ocular Syndrome (SANS). I've received a $50,000 award as part of the NSF I-Corps Program for this work. My dissertation proposal revolves around anomaly detection in assessment-based time series data using generative AI and diffusion models. I have a strong {{< staticref "https://scholar.google.com/citations?hl=en&user=kl3_YggAAAAJ" "newtab" >}}publication record{{< /staticref >}} in virtual reality, computer vision, machine learning, and deep learning. 

In 2024 summer during my PhD software engineer internship at Google Research (Health AI) in Mountain View, California, I focused on temporal modeling of geospatial data to predict disease progression leveraging advanced graph neural network based models to analyze large datasets and uncover patterns in the spread of diseases over time and across different regions. During the Fall 2023 semester, I served as an instructor for the graduate-level course "Elements of Research Computing" (Introduction to Linux). In the summer of 2023, I interned as a Ph.D. software developer with SGX3 at the University of Texas at Austin, where I developed interactive applications for high-performance computing. Additionally, in the summers of 2021 and 2022, I had the privilege of working as a mentor for the Army Educational Outreach Program (AEOP). Before pursuing my Ph.D., I served as a team lead and senior software QA automation engineer, playing a key role in team growth and building lasting client and team relationships.

I have always had a natural affinity for numbers and problem-solving, which led me to develop a strong interest in computer programming. My journey began with learning Visual Basic in Windows XP in 2006, and since then, I've continued to explore and enhance my skills. Analyzing data to solve complex problems, and tackling analytical math problems, as well as coding challenges on competitive programming platforms, remain my passions.
